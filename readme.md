# Homework 10: Technical Challenges and Collaborative Solutions

## Addressing Issues and Enhancing Functionality

### 1) Alignment of Login/Register Data in OpenAPI Documentation:
Ensuring consistency between the user data required for registration and login proved crucial in enhancing the user experience. By synchronizing the username and password parameters across registration and login processes, we mitigated errors during login attempts. This alignment not only resolved immediate issues but also laid the groundwork for smoother user interactions.

### 2) Refinement of AsyncSession and Username Validation:
Encountering an undefined function within AsyncSession and lax username validation prompted a thorough overhaul. We revamped the codebase, leveraging different packages and refining the username validation process to accept only lowercase letters. These adjustments not only improved functionality but also fortified the application's security.

### 3) Strengthening Profile Validation:
Identification of discrepancies and extraneous spaces in user-provided data necessitated meticulous revisions. By implementing stringent validation measures and trimming excess spaces, we fortified the application's data integrity. Corresponding updates to test cases ensured thorough validation across scenarios.
